# Personalized-Life-Counter

I regularly play Magic The Gathering, a card game, with some friends. 

So I made this life counter to learn how to use Kivy and python in order to do a mobile app, and at the same time have a life counter where we can see our head directly where our life is. 

I am still working on it. The final goal is to be able to import an image directly from your phone and put it where your life is.
